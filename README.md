This is an android application which allow user to write their own enties in their second language, In other hand 
they can correct posts written by their mother's tangue languages which had been written by another people.

We are you using website Parse.com to store the data in cloud for instense( Posts, Comments, User's info ..etc).
If you would like to take a look at the database just send me an email asking for our account's login in parse.com

It take a long time to write this story (which is my first android app), So enjoy it!
